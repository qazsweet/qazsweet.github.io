Translate the tyle of one picture to another.

The original one is:

![1st](/images/blog/zermatt.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

The translated one is:
![1st](/images/blog/test.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

Try on my logo as fooooooooooooooooooolloooooooooooow:

![1st](/images/blog/logo1.jpg){:height="30%" width="30%"}

![2nd](/images/blog/logo2.jpg){:height="30%" width="30%"}


Do you know which one are these learned from? Is it obvious?
